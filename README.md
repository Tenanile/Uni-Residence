# Uni-Residence
The Uni-Residence system is designed to streamline the process of student accommodation at the University of Eswatini (UNESWA). This web-based application, built using PHP CodeIgniter and MySQL, aims to provide a digital platform for students, landlords, and administrators to manage housing applications, bookings, and tenancy efficiently.
